## Flyweight

Wikipedia says

> In computer programming, flyweight is a software design pattern. A flyweight is an object that \nminimizes memory use by sharing as much data as \npossible with other similar objects; it is a way \nto use objects in large numbers when a simple repeated representation would use an unacceptable \namount of memory.
