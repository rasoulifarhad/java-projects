Real world example

> We have a hierarchy of modem classes. The modems in this hierarchy need to be visited by an external algorithm based on filtering criteria (is it Unix or DOS compatible modem).

In plain words

> Acyclic Visitor allows functions to be added to existing class hierarchies without modifying the hierarchies.
