	// 1. When a client calls `Incentive` with an `employee_id`, `Incentive` fetches the list of applicable KPIs for that employee.
    // 2. It then makes a call to each KPI class. While calling a specific KPI class, it checks the employeeâ€™s department and, based on that, creates an object of the appropriate `KPI+Dep` class and calls its method to calculate the incentive for that KPI.
    // 3. The calculated value is then passed back to the `Incentive` class. `Incentive` class will sum up incentive amount from each KPI and give that to Client.
