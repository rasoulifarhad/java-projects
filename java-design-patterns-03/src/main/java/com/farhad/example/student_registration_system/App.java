// A student registration system is needed that will allow students to register for courses and view report cards. Professors will 
// be able to access the system to sign up to teach courses as well as record grades. The system will allow students to select four 
// course offerings for the coming semester. In addition, each student will indicate two alternative choices in case the student 
// cannot be assigned to a primary selection. For each semester, there is a period of time that students can change their schedule 
// by adding or dropping courses [Quat00].
