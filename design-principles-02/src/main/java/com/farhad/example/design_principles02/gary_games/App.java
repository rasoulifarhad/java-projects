// Gary’s Games – Vision Statement
//
// Gary’s Games provides frameworks that game designers can use to create turn-based strategy games.Unlike arcade-style 
// shoot-’em-up games and games that rely on audio and video features to engage the player,our games will focus on the 
// technical details of strategy and tactics.Our framework provides the bookkeeping details to make building a particular 
// game easy,while removing the burden of coding repetitive tasks from the game design.
//
// he game system framework (GSF) will provide the core of all of Gary’s Games.It will be delivered as a library of classes 
// with a well-defined API that should be usable by all board game development project teams within the company.The 
// framework will provide standard capabilities for:
//
// - Defining and representing a board configuration
// - Defining troops and configuring armies or other fighting units
// - Moving units on the board
// - Determining legal moves
// - Conducting battles
// - Providing unit information
//
// The GSF will simplify the task of developing a turn-based strategic board game so that the users of the GSF can devote 
// their time to implementing the actual games.
