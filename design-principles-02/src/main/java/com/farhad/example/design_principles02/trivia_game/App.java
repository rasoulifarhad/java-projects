// The overall design of our trivia game is straightforward: players take turns rolling a single die, and 
// move around a circular board. When they land on a square, they are asked a trivia question of some 
// category. 
//
// - You can add players to the game, and you can ask the game how many players are playing.
// - Once the game has started, players cannot be added or removed.
