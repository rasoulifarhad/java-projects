The production plan has a demand and price for each province. Each province has
producers, each of which can produce a certain number of units at a particular price.
The UI also shows how much revenue each producer would earn if they sell all their
production. At the bottom, the screen shows the shortfall in production (the demand
minus the total production) and the profit for this plan. The UI allows the user to
manipulate the demand, price, and the individual producerâ€™s production and costs to
see the effect on the production shortfall and profits. Whenever a user changes any
number in the display, all the others update immediately.
