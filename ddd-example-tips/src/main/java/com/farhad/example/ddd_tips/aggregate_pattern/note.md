Now, the business has asked you to limit the possibility to order more than 100 hundred items or for more than $5,000.

### Aggregate Pattern

This is a classic usage example of the famous Aggregate Pattern. Although some try to identify aggregates by looking for matching domain concepts, the patternâ€™s real purpose is to help you ensure transactional consistency between your entities.

Order class should be an aggregate over the OrderPosition class. This implies the following:


- The Order class is responsible for ensuring the maximum amount of positions and their maximum balance.
- The Order class requires some concurrency mechanism e.g. optimistic locking (AKA versioning).
- There will be an OrderRepository class in the system, but not an OrderPositionRepository class.
- The addPosition operation has to be performed in a transaction.
