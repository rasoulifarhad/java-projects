Shopping Basket Discount

Items in a shopping basket have a unit price and quantity. Write code that will allow you to:

    find out the quantity of a particular item in the basket
    calculate the total price of the whole basket, including any applicable discount

Normally the total price is the sum of unit price * quantity for all the items. If you buy in bulk you get a discount:

    If total basket value > $100, apply a 5% discount
    If total basket value > $200, apply a 10% discount

Example

    Item A: price $10, quantity 5
    Item B: price $25, quantity 2
    Item C: price $9.99, quantity 6

This basket qualifies for a 5% discount and the total price is $151.94
