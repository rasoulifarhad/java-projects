## Scoring

In ten-pin bowling there are 10 frames per game. A strike occurs when all 10 pins are knocked down on a bowler's first roll. A spare occurs when there are pins standing after the first roll, and the bowler knocks down the rest of the pins on the second roll. A spare gives the bowler an amount of "bonus pins" equal to the next roll, and a strike gives the bowler an amount of bonus pins equal to the sum of the next two rolls.

### concept of the last completed frame?

the score of the game at any point in time is the score in the last completed frame.

A completed frame is a frame that you can write the score into, right?

Yes, a frame with a spare in it completes after the next ball. A frame with a strike in it completes after the next two balls. A frame with no mark completes after the second ball in the frame.
