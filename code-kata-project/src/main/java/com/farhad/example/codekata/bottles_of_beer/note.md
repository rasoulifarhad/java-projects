The song method imposes a single dependency; to use it, you need only know its name.

Using the verses method to request the entire song, however, requires significantly more knowledge. The sender must know:

- the name of the verses method
- that the method requires two arguments
- that the first argument is the verse on which to start
- that the second argument is the verse on which to end
- that the song starts on verse 99
- that the song ends on verse 0

Here song is the intention, and verses(99, 0) is the implementation. There’s a big difference between wanting the lyrics for a range of verses, and wanting the lyrics for the entire song. The verses method is in the public API, so it must continue to exist, but its existence doesn’t obviate the need for song. Senders of the song message want all of the verses, and they oughtn’t be forced to trouble themselves with details about how this happens.


new requirement: 

users have requested that you alter the 99 Bottles code to output "1 six-pack" in each place where it currently says "6 bottles."

Flocking Rules

1. Select the things that are most alike.
2. Find the smallest difference between them.
3. Make the simplest change that will remove that difference.  

Changes to code can be subdivided into four distinct steps:

1. parse the new code
2. parse and execute it
3. parse, execute and use its result
4. delete unused code                                           

As you’re following the flocking rules:

- For now, change only one line at a time.
- Run the tests after every change.
- If the tests fail, undo and make a better change.

Difference holds the key to understanding. If two concrete examples represent the same abstraction and they contain a difference, that difference must represent a smaller abstraction within the larger one. If you can name the difference, you’ve identified that smaller abstraction.


To reduce the verse switch statement to a single line of code, the rules say to first identify the things that are most alike. This means that you should select the two branches that are most alike, and focus on making them identical.

The general rule is that the name of a thing should be one level of abstraction higher than the thing itself. The strings "bottle/bottles/six-pack" are instances of some category, and the task is to name that category using language of the domain.
