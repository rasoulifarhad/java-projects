You work for a theater, and you're working on a suggestion system for seat allocations. During the process of buying tickets, the customer is offered the best seats available in a given price range. They will be shown a diagram of the theater with all the available seats shown, and the suggested seats highlighted. The customer will be able to change to different seats if they wish.   You do not need to write the code to display the theater layout with the suggested seats highlighted. You just have to write the code that decides which seats to suggest.


 Offer seats following these rules, in this order:  

    do not offer any seat that is already booked by another customer
    offer adjacent seats to members of the same party
    offer seats nearer the middle of a row
    offer seats nearer the stage
