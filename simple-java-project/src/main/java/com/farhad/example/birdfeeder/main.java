// Recall that a user story usually takes the form: 
// “As a <role>, I want to <action>, in order to <benefit>.”
//
// “As Alice, the owner, I want to open and close the bird feeder 
// doors with a remote control, in order to keep the predator 
// birds away from the feeder.”
//
// From this user story we can generate a scenario that fleshes out what Alice 
// wants to do, which might look like this: “Alice is sitting at her kitchen 
// table having her morning coffee. doors opened when the sun came out this morning 
// and the feeder has attracted several songbirds. As Alice is watching the songbirds, 
// a couple of blue jays arrive, chase the songbirds off, and begin feasting on the 
// birdseed. Alice reaches for the remote control and presses the button. The bird 
// feeder doors close smoothly and the blue jays fly off. Alice presses the remote 
// control button again and the doors open. After a while the songbirds return and 
// Alice can finish her coffee.”
//
// Our previous use case looked like this:
// 1. The sensor detects sunlight at a 40% brightness level.
// 2. The feeding doors open.
// 3. The birds arrive, eat, and drink.
// 4. The birds leave.
// 5. The sensor detects a decrease in sunlight to a 25% brightness level.
// 6. The feeding doors close
// 
// A remote control use case:
// 1. Alice hears or sees birds at the bird feeder.
// 2. Alice determines that they are not songbirds.
// 3. Alice presses the remote control button.
// . The feeding doors close.
// 5. The birds give up and fly away.
// 6. Alice presses the remote control button.
// 7. The feeding doors open again.
