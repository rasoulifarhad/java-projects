// This was a wonderfully imaginative and sophisticated game for its time, 
// involving finding your way through a complex cave system, locating hidden 
// treasure, using secret words, and other mysteries, all in an effort to 
// score the maximum number of points. 
//
// CommandWord  defines all valid commands in the game.
// Parser The parser reads lines of input from the terminal and tries to interpret them as commands.
// Command A Command object represents a command that was entered by the user.
// Room A Room object represents a location in a game. Rooms can have exits that lead to other rooms.
// Game The Game class is the main class of the game. It sets the game up, and then enters a loop to 
//      read and execute commands. It also contains the code that implements each user command.
//
// The first task we will attempt is to add a new direction of movement. Currently, a player
// can move in four directions: north, east, south, and west. We want to allow for multilevel
// buildings (or cellars, or dungeons, or whatever you later want to add to your game) and
// add up and down as possible directions. A player can then type "go down" to move, say,
// down into a cellar.
