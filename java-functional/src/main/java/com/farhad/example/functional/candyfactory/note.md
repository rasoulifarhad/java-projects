### Problem

Right now we only make one kind of candy: a small piece of disc-shaped chocolate in a hard candy shell. Even though that's our only product, we do make them in many colors. Every bag of candy contains an assortment of red, blue, green, and yellow pieces.

### First story off the backlog	

> Count how many pieces of candy with a given color are in a bag 

>> As a factory line quality control manager, I want to randomly choose bags of candy coming off the line and separate out the colors. That way I can perform my tasks more quickly.

<br/>

>> One of my tasks is to count how many pieces of candy in each bag have a given color.

<br/>

>> This will help me to insure that each bag has enough of any given color on average to keep fans of that color happy.

<br/>

### Expanding the line 

> We decide to experiment with two new types of candy:

>> Peanut

<br/>

>> Pretzel

<br/>
