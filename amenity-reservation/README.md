# AmenityReservation

This app was created with Bootify.io - tips on working with the code [can be found here](https://bootify.io/next-steps/).
Feel free to contact us for further questions.

## Development

Update your local database connection in `application.yml` or create your own `application-local.yml` file to override
settings for development.

During development it is recommended to use the profile `local`. In IntelliJ `-Dspring.profiles.active=local` can be
added in the VM options of the Run Configuration after enabling this property in "Modify options".

Lombok must be supported by your IDE. For IntelliJ install the Lombok plugin and enable annotation processing -
[learn more](https://bootify.io/next-steps/spring-boot-with-lombok.html).

In addition to the Spring Boot application, the development server must also be started - for this
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 20 is required. Angular CLI and required dependencies must be installed once:

```
npm install -g @angular/cli
npm install
```

The development server can be started as follows:

```
ng serve
```

Your application is now accessible under `localhost:4200`.

Add code using Angular schematics with `ng generate ...`.
Frontend unit tests can be executed with `ng test`.
Generate a messages.json for translation with `ng extract-i18n â€“format=json`.

## Build

The application can be built using the following command:

```
mvnw clean package
```

Start your application with the following command - here with the profile `production`:

```
java -Dspring.profiles.active=production -jar ./target/amenity-reservation-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

If required, a Docker image can be created with the Spring Boot plugin. Add `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=production` as
environment variable when running the container.

```
mvnw spring-boot:build-image -Dspring-boot.build-image.imageName=com.farhad.example/amenity-reservation
```
