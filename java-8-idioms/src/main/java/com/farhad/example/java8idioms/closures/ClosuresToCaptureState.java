	// Lexical scoping:
	// 
	// Functions expect variables to be in scope. Because they are anonymous functions at heart, lambdas 
	// expect variables referenced to be in scope, as well. Some variables are received as parameters to 
	// functions or lambdas. Some variables are defined locally. And some variables come from outside the 
	// function, in what's called the lexical scope.
	// 
	// A lexical scope is the defining scope of a function. In turn, it may also be the defining scope of 
	// the defining scope, and so on.
	//
	// In the previous code, the method run does not define location or receive it as a parameter. The defining 
	// scope of run is the anonymous inner object of Runnable. Because location is not defined as a field in that 
	// instance, the search continues to the defining scope of the anonymous inner objectâ€”in this case the local 
	// scope of the method print.

    // If location were not present in the scope, the compiler's search would continue in the defining scope of 
	// print, continuing until either the variable was found or the search failed.
