> First Requirement

>> As a business, I want to generate a person’s resume in PDF with the person’s name and the date until the resume is valid which is the current date

<br/>

> Second: New Requirement

>> As a business, I want to generate another kind of resume, a long person’s resume in PDF with the person’s name, a description and the date until the resume is valid, which is the current date plus 7 days.

<br/>

>> This means, we have now two kinds of resume, ***the basic resume and the long resume***.

<br/>

>> Seems like a kind of resume could be an extension point of our module.
